"I felt like rating the robots performance on how they completed the action was a bit difficult. I think it woudk've been easier if the rating was based off on a scale from 1 to 10 or rating from ""Action was done wrong"", """"Action was done half right"", ""Action was done completely right"" or something like that. But rating it on a scale from 1 to 100 feels way too specific and broad for this."
Not exactly sure.
