"Actually yes. It felt like the clips were a little short at times, meaning that once the clip went through I would then decide maybe I should have rated it differently."
There were instances I would rate the action of pouring the cup as not perfect but close because I felt that the robot could have tilted the cup a little further to make sure all of whatever may be in it comes out. There were also instances when the robot performed half the action which prompted me to use a rating of 50.
