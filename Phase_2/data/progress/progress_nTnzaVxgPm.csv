"I'm very confused by this question. In regards to the experiment, I only rated each part out of 5 for completion. For example, on the last situation, he didn't grab the cup, which means that he subsequently couldn't pour from the cup and couldn't set the cup back down, so all of those parts received a 0. However, he did grab the spoon (which was one of the steps), so I gave him credit for that. However, the spoon couldn't stir the beads (because there were no beads), so he didn't get credit for that. So since he only got 1 out of 5 steps, he received a 20%. I don't know if this is what the question is asking because I'm unclear on the ""teaching signal."""
