"Yes, there was a video where the robot failed to pick up the blue cup but I couldn't tell if the robot was at the first step or the step where the robot sets the cup down after pouring the balls into the green cup."
"Yes, if I the video showed the robot pouring the jelly balls in the blue cup into the green cup, I would be able to accurately rate the robot's task completion rate as 50%, since the robot has completed 2 out of 5 steps in the task. Also, If the robot was unable to pick up the blue cup, I would be able to accurately rate the robot's task completion rate as 0%, since the robot has not completed any steps in the task."
